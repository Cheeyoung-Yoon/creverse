0,basic,Advanced,"Imagine you were surfing with your friend and a tsunami started to form. If you knew a tsunami was forming like the video, what would you do first? Write a paragraph with two reasons to support your answer.","I will move to a higher ground. I have two reasons. First, Because tsunamis are dangerous. Because tsunamis can sweep us away. Second, tsunamis are big waves. But it can't come at the high ground. For these reasons, I will move to a higher ground.",247,46.152436,success,0,22,0,"The paragraph has multiple basic grammatical problems: sentence fragments, incorrect articles and collocations (a higher ground → higher ground), pronoun and verb agreement (it → they; can't come at → cannot reach), incorrect capitalization, and repetitive, short sentences. These errors make the writing elementary and prevent it from meeting advanced-level expectations for sophisticated structures and varied vocabulary. Revise by combining ideas into complex sentences (use subordinate clauses), ",5,I will move to a higher ground. → I will move to higher ground. / I will move to a higher elevation.,1,"Score justification: The introduction contains a clear thesis and direction (hence 1 point), but it falls short of advanced-level expectations. The writing is very simple, repetitive and contains sentence fragments and grammatical errors (e.g. incorrect capitalization, unclear pronouns, unnecessary articles). To reach the higher band, provide brief context about tsunamis, use varied and more precise vocabulary, combine short fragments into complex sentences, and preview the argument in a single ",5,"I will move to a higher ground. → Rewrite as: ""I will move to higher ground."" or better: ""Because tsunamis threaten coastal safety, I plan to move to higher ground.""",0,"The body lacks sophistication: sentences are fragmented, repetitive and offer no development, evidence or nuance. To reach an advanced level, write a clear topic sentence, develop each reason with specific explanation or brief evidence (e.g., how currents and debris cause harm), and link points with complex sentences and transitions. Avoid vague words like 'big' and absolute claims like 'can't.' Also correct grammar (no capital after 'Because' mid-sentence; use 'higher ground' not 'a higher grou",5,I will move to a higher ground. → Use 'higher ground' without 'a' and integrate into a stronger topic sentence: 'I would move to higher ground because it substantially reduces the risk of drowning and,0,"The conclusion is fragmented, repetitive and lacks the sophisticated synthesis expected at an advanced level. Sentences are often sentence fragments (starting with 'Because'), vocabulary is basic ('big waves'), and the paragraph simply restates points instead of integrating them into a decisive, insightful close. To improve, combine the reasons into one or two complex sentences that synthesize risk and recommended action (e.g., mention currents, debris, inundation briefly), avoid meta-comments l",7,I will move to a higher ground. → I will seek higher ground.,46.13790603200141
