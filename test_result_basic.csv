0,basic,Basic,"Imagine you were surfing with your friend and a tsunami started to form. If you knew a tsunami was forming like the video, what would you do first? Write a paragraph with two reasons to support your answer.","I will move to a higher ground. I have two reasons. First, Because tsunamis are dangerous. Because tsunamis can sweep us away. Second, tsunamis are big waves. But it can't come at the high ground. For these reasons, I will move to a higher ground.",247,45.062859,success,2,17,2,"Your message is very clear — good job! Work on joining short sentences (avoid starting sentences with 'Because') and small grammar points: use 'they' for tsunamis, say 'move to higher ground' (no 'a'), and use 'reach' instead of 'come at'. Keep practicing — your ideas are easy to understand.",4,I will move to a higher ground. → I will move to higher ground.,2,"Good introduction: you clearly say your topic (moving to higher ground) and you tell the reader you will give two reasons. Very clear for a basic level. To improve, avoid sentence fragments that start with 'Because', make subjects clear (say 'tsunamis' instead of 'it'), and use simpler correct phrases like 'higher ground' without 'a'. You could combine ideas into one smooth sentence: for example, 'I will move to higher ground because tsunamis are dangerous and can sweep people away.' Well done—k",4,I will move to a higher ground. → I will move to higher ground.,2,"Good effort — you give two clear reasons (tsunamis are dangerous and are big waves). For A1–A2 level this is fine. Improve by fixing small grammar issues: don't start sentences with 'Because' alone, use 'tsunamis' not 'it', and say 'move to higher ground' (no 'a'). Add a short detail to the second reason (how big waves hurt people or damage houses) and combine ideas into one or two full sentences for smoother flow.",5,I will move to a higher ground. → I will move to higher ground.,1,"Good attempt — you clearly try to restate your decision and reasons. The conclusion needs clearer sentences and small grammar fixes: don't start sentences with 'Because' alone, use 'higher ground' (no 'a'), and use 'tsunamis' (they/them) not 'it'. Try one or two combined sentences for a smoother ending. Example: ""I will move to higher ground because tsunamis are dangerous and can sweep people away, and because they are big waves that cannot reach high ground.""",4,I will move to a higher ground. → I will move to higher ground.,44.900864236000416
