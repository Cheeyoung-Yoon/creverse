0,basic,Expert,"Imagine you were surfing with your friend and a tsunami started to form. If you knew a tsunami was forming like the video, what would you do first? Write a paragraph with two reasons to support your answer.","I will move to a higher ground. I have two reasons. First, Because tsunamis are dangerous. Because tsunamis can sweep us away. Second, tsunamis are big waves. But it can't come at the high ground. For these reasons, I will move to a higher ground.",247,52.127126,success,0,20,0,"The text contains several basic grammatical problems inappropriate for an expert-level writer: multiple sentence fragments (sentences beginning with 'Because'), incorrect article use with 'higher ground', inconsistent pronoun number (using 'it' for 'tsunamis'), and an incorrect verb/preposition combination ('come at'). The piece also lacks complex sentence structures and cohesive linking: combine clauses (e.g. 'First, tsunamis are dangerous because they can sweep people away.'), maintain consist",5,a higher ground → higher ground,0,"This introduction is elementary: it relies on short, repetitive sentences, sentence fragments beginning with 'Because', imprecise vocabulary, and an undeveloped thesis. For an expert-level introduction, begin with a contextualised hook (a striking fact, scenario or broader significance), present a nuanced thesis that avoids simple repetition, and preview the essay’s structure in one polished sentence. Improve sentence variety, correct grammar (avoid fragments), use precise vocabulary (e.g. 'imme",5,"I will move to a higher ground. → Open with a contextualised, compelling sentence: e.g. ""When coastal communities face the sudden roar of a tsunami, moving to higher ground is often the only sure safe",0,"The body fails to meet expert-level expectations. Sentences are short, repetitive and include fragments that start with 'Because'; there is no development, evidence, or nuanced analysis. To reach a C1/expert standard, write a clear topic sentence that states a precise claim, then develop each reason in a full, logically ordered paragraph: explain how the hazard works, provide concrete evidence or example, and analyse the implication for your decision (show causation, likelihood and limits). Vary",5,"I will move to a higher ground. → State a precise, nuanced claim: ""I will move to higher ground to reduce the risk of drowning and impact injuries if a tsunami strikes.""",0,"The conclusion fails to meet expert expectations: it is repetitive, grammatically flawed, and offers no synthesis or broader insight. To reach C1/expert level, state your decision once, weave the reasons into a polished, causal sentence (showing how higher ground reduces specific hazards), acknowledge limits or contingencies (e.g. access, topography), and close with a broader implication or call to action. Avoid meta‑statements ('I have two reasons') and sentence fragments beginning with 'Becaus",5,"I will move to a higher ground. → Use 'I will move to higher ground.' once, as a concise thesis statement that avoids repetition.",52.10865841600025
