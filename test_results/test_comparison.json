I think that reunification of North and South Korea is not possible\n\nFirst of all, there are political differences between North and South Korea. North and South Korea has very different political systems and ideologies. North Korea's system is centralized and authoritarian, with a unique political system that combines elements of communism and totalitarianism. North Korea's political system is primarily based on a one-man leadership system and the Juche ideology. South Korea, on the other hand, is a liberal democracy based on a presidential system in which representatives elected by the people from the National Assembly and the government to make and enforce laws. Democratic principles such as a free press, freedom of expression, and fair elections are guaranteed.\n\nAdditionally, there are social and cultural barriers between Koreas. Korean War has led to different political systems and social and cultural characteristics of two Koreas. North Korea maintains a communist system in which the state controls all industries and agriculture, but South Korea has a free market economy and guarantees individual economic freedom. These differences have a major impact on the structure of society and the standard of living. North and South Korea also differ in language and cultural expression. North and South Korea use different Koreans. Also, North Korea emphasizes communist education and culture, while South Korea respects diverse cultures and arts.\n\nTo conclude, I think that reunification of two Koreas is impossible because there are political differences and political differences between North and South Korea."

Because these days many teenagers bully other kid with their face or their body. So the bullied kid could get stressed. When they get a lot of stress the bullied kid would think that she really face and bad and she is fat. But when they do cosmetic surgery they don't have to bleed by shoal classmate. They don't have to be afraid.\n\nSecond, I think teenagers can't do cosmetic surgery is a discrimination because teenagers is being an adult. The are not young. So I think teenagers can do cosmetic surgery. Also, these days, there have many safety cosmetic surgery equipments and these they science has developed so there have a lot of smart robots. So, I think cosmetic surgery for teenagers is safe and not have sideffects.\n\nThird, when teenagers do cosmetic surgery it is their choice when they don't like it, they can't turn it back. Teenagers had developed brain so their choice and the result is their fault or their good. When they go out in soical they will have to choose more big thing then cosmetic surgery. Their choose would change their life or better or become worse. So, teenagers could practice with this cosmetic surgery. When they want to do surgery.\n\nThese are the reason that I think teenagers should have cosmetic surgery."
