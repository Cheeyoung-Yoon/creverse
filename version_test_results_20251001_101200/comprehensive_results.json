        "submit_text": "Do you believe that reunification of Korea is possible? Many people are putting efforts on reunification, but there are very hard problems to solve for reunifying. I think that reunification of North and South Korea is not possible\n\nFirst of all, there are political differences between North and South Korea. North and South Korea has very different political systems and ideologies. North Korea's system is centralized and authoritarian, with a unique political system that combines elements of communism and totalitarianism. North Korea's political system is primarily based on a one-man leadership system and the Juche ideology. South Korea, on the other hand, is a liberal democracy based on a presidential system in which representatives elected by the people from the National Assembly and the government to make and enforce laws. Democratic principles such as a free press, freedom of expression, and fair elections are guaranteed.\n\nAdditionally, there are social and cultural barriers between Koreas. Korean War has led to different political systems and social and cultural characteristics of two Koreas. North Korea maintains a communist system in which the state controls all industries and agriculture, but South Korea has a free market economy and guarantees individual economic freedom. These differences have a major impact on the structure of society and the standard of living. North and South Korea also differ in language and cultural expression. North and South Korea use different Koreans. Also, North Korea emphasizes communist education and culture, while South Korea respects diverse cultures and arts.\n\nTo conclude, I think that reunification of two Koreas is impossible because there are political differences and political differences between North and South Korea.",

        "topic_prompt": "Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Compulsory military service should be abolished.",
        "submit_text": "There are many compulsory military services working nowadays. I believe this is a helpful service and is beneficial to most people. Therefore, I disagree that compulsory military service should be abolished because of the following reasons.\n\nFirst of all, we should own a compulsory military service because we can not only protect one person who pays the fee. What I mean by this is that if we try to protect one person, everyone is somehow protected. For example, in one county that abolished compulsory military services, there was a man named Mr. Man. He wanted to protect himself, so he paid the fine to the military service center. The service center agreed to protect him, and Mr. Man went back home. However, not only Mr. Man, everyone in that country was protected. In wars, to protect Mr. Man, they need to protect the whole country to do it. Then, it could be somewhat too unfair to the people who pay the fine for their own services. Next, the people will complain to the military service center and many people can go crazy. Therefore, I believe we should not abolish compulsory military services because people who pay the fine can be unfair.\n\nSecond, poor people could not have the money to pay for their military services. If we abolish compulsory military services, we should pay fines for whom wants protection for themselves. Then, only the middle or upper class could afford the money to protect themselves. Then, what about the poor people? They should have the opportunity to get some protection because they are the people living in one country too. People would not want them to die. For example, if a military service per year is 1000 dollars, and if one poor person's annual payment is 1500 dollars, they would not havethe money to protect themselves because everything else would go into food, and clothes, extra. In conclusion, I believe that we should not abolish any compulsory military services.\n\nLastly, we should no abolish any compulsory military services because the majority of military workers could not work there any more. They would have less military workers, because some people would not pay the fine in any reasons, and that could lead to less people working in military services that when we have services for everyone in one country. For instance, if we had about 50 thousand military workers right now, and if many people do not pay the fees, military workers would be fired because they are no use anymore. Then, many people would have lost their jobs, and this could also lead to economic issues like too many people not having jobs, and the country having a lack of economic growth. Therefore, I believe that we should not abolish compulsory military services.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that compulsory military services should be abolished because it can be unfair to those who pay his fine, poor people should be protected as well as other people, and because many military workers can lose their jobs, which can lead to a lack of economic growth.",
